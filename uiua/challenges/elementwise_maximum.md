Write a function that takes two arrays of the same length and returns an array of the element-wise maximum values from
the two arrays.

### Example

**Input:**

$$
[3, 5, 9, 2], \quad [4, 2, 8, 7]
$$

**Output:**

$$
[4, 5, 9, 7]
$$

### Explanation:

For each corresponding pair of elements in the two arrays, return the larger value. So, for the first position, you'd
take the maximum of 3 and 4 (which is 4), for the second position, the maximum of 5 and 2 (which is 5), and so on.
