Write a function that takes an array and returns a boolean array indicating whether each element is a perfect square.

### Example

**Input:**

$$
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 16, 20]
$$

**Output:**

$$
[\texttt{True}, \texttt{False}, \texttt{False}, \texttt{True}, \texttt{False}, \texttt{True}, \texttt{True}, \texttt{False}]
$$

### Explanation:

For each element, determine if it is a perfect square (i.e., an integer that can be expressed as the square of another
integer).
