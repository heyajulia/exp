Write a function that takes a single array and returns a new array where each element is doubled, but only if itâ€™s an
odd number.

### Example

**Input:**

$$
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
$$

**Output:**

$$
[2, 2, 6, 4, 10]
$$

### Explanation:

For each element, if it's odd, double it; if it's even, leave it unchanged.
