Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns a new array where each element is replaced by the number of
divisors it has.

### Example

**Input:**

$$
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
$$

**Output:**

$$
[2, 3, 2, 4, 2]
$$

### Explanation:

For each number in the input array, you need to count how many integers divide it evenly. For example, 3 has two
divisors (1 and 3), while 6 has four divisors (1, 2, 3, 6).
